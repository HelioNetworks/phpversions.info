                    The intent of this project is to give PHP developers across the world
                    visibility in to what versions of PHP are offered from host platforms across
                    the world as well as various distrubtions.
                    <br><br>
                    PHP has had its ups and down as a language, and one thing that suffered most was a release schedule
                    that for the longest time was inconsistent. As of late, the language has put in place a rigid, fast paced
                    release schedule which has been welcomed across the community. An unintended consequence of this is that hosts
                    are still slow to offer the latest version of PHP and instead still offer out of date and out of security support versions.
                    <br><br>
                    We want to change that.

                    This project would not be possible without various open source technologies. Becuase of these technologies, we were
                    able to work on this project and help others by sharing our data.
